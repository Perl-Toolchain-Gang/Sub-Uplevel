      stack depth

0.15_01 Thu Jul  5 22:54:08 EDT 2007
    - Won't override any existing CORE::GLOBAL::caller when loaded 
    - Localize global caller() override to the scope of the uplevel() call 
      so it can play nicer with things like Contextual::Return and
      Hook::LexWrap that also override caller()

0.14 Sun Nov  5 23:38:46 EST 2006
    - fixed t/99_pod_coverage.t bug
    - added examples directory

0.13 Thu Jun 22 19:47:26 EDT 2006

    - switched ok(eq_array()) tests to is_deeper() for better diagnostics

    - numbered tests

0.12 Fri May 12 18:33:40 EDT 2006
    - official release of the uplevel stack patch (fixes RT#13893)

    - removed SIGNATURE due to recently discovered Module::Signature
      issues with newline handling and sub-key compatible keyservers
    - updated/added various meta files

0.11_01 Fri Apr 21 00:49:51 EDT 2006
    - uplevel now keeps a proper stack of uplevel calls allowing
      nesting of uplevel and non-uplevel calls

    - Stopped warnings about "undefined" on Perl 5.8.8

0.08  Wed Oct 22 09:02:38 PDT 2003
    - New die_check.t test was written in a non-portable manner.
      [Thanks Martin Thurn and cpantesters]

0.07  Tue Mar 18 03:03:22 GMT 2003
    - Fixed a test bug due to 5.6.0's differing Carp::croak stack output

0.06  Thu Sep 20 08:50:30 EDT 2001
    * Fixed a bug with deeply nested callers.
    * Fixed nested uplevel() calls.
    - Forgot to include Test::More dependency
    - Added 5.006 dependency to Makefile.PL
    - Removed unnecessary die and warn overrides
    - Added DIRE WARNING to the docs.

0.05  Wed Sep 19 06:00:12 EDT 2001
    * Things were still pretty broken.  I *think* I have the tests
      sorted out now.
    * Blows over any CORE::GLOBAL::caller, die or warn you might have
      set.  I'll fix this soon.

0.04  Wed Sep 19 04:28:19 EDT 2001
    * Ooops, we'd broken caller().  Turns out the tests were wrong.

0.03  Wed Sep 19 03:41:59 EDT 2001
    * Greatly simplified the uplevel logic

0.02  Wed Sep 19 03:03:10 EDT 2001
    * Fools croak()

0.01  Wed Sep 19 00:19:38 EDT 2001
    * First working version
    * Fools caller(), die() and warn().
    - Needs more work against, say, Carp.
    - Needs more work to check that it doesn't break the
      subtleties of caller, die and warn.
