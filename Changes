0.06  Thu Sep 20 08:50:30 EDT 2001
    * Fixed a bug with deeply nested callers.
    * Fixed nested uplevel() calls.

0.05  Wed Sep 19 06:00:12 EDT 2001
    * Things were still pretty broken.  I *think* I have the tests
      sorted out now.
    * Blows over any CORE::GLOBAL::caller, die or warn you might have
      set.  I'll fix this soon.

0.04  Wed Sep 19 04:28:19 EDT 2001
    * Ooops, we'd broken caller().  Turns out the tests were wrong.

0.03  Wed Sep 19 03:41:59 EDT 2001
    * Greatly simplified the uplevel logic

0.02  Wed Sep 19 03:03:10 EDT 2001
    * Fools croak()

0.01  Wed Sep 19 00:19:38 EDT 2001
    * First working version
    * Fools caller(), die() and warn().
    - Needs more work against, say, Carp.
    - Needs more work to check that it doesn't break the
      subtleties of caller, die and warn.
